# VMS - Calendar Module

This module is a Typescript/Javascript calendar module to be used inside the VMS (Volunteer Management System).

This is created from scratch and it will be lots of development...

I also, have no clue what I am doing... I am learning as I go.

**IMPORTANT** This is not production ready - at least for now
